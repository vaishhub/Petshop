        <p style="font-size:15px">Rabies is a viral disease that affects the nervous system and is almost always fatal if left untreated. 
          It is spread through the saliva of infected animals, often through a bite or scratch. 
          Vaccination is the best way to prevent rabies.</p>
         <b style="font-size: 20px ; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" > What Are the Symptoms of Rabies?</b>
         <p style="font-size:15px">If your dog is bitten by another animal and you are worried about rabies,
           pay close attention to their behavior and call your vet immediately if you have reason to suspect rabies.</p>
           <h3>Treatment for rabies in dogs</h3>
            <p style="font-size:15px">There is no cure for the rabies virus, and for any unvaccinated dog, the result is fatal.
             Because rabies presents a severe health risk, to prevent further transmission of the disease to other animals and humans, the dog is most often euthanized.
             In dogs that have been vaccinated against rabies, a booster vaccine is administered if there is a possibility they have been infected.
             This helps to strengthen the dog's immunity to rabies and reduces the chances of the virus developing.
             Even if a dog has been vaccinated, if rabies is suspected, he may still be required to undergo observation for up to 7-10 days.
             If your dog is bitten by another person's pet, try to obtain as much information on that animal as possible, particularly vaccine history and a rabies tag number or dog license number (if available).
             A rabies diagnosis is required by law to be reported to the local health depacommonlyrtment.
             Unvaccinated dogs bitten or exposed to a rabid animal must be quarantined for up to six months, according to local and state regulations.
              A vaccinated dog that has attacked another animal, or human, will also be quarantined in an approved facility, and can still face euthanization.</p>

        <p>Canine Parvovirus<br>
          Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a highly contagious viral disease of dogs that commonly causes acute gastrointestinal illness in puppies. 
          The disease most often strikes in pups between six and 20 weeks old, but older animals are sometimes also affected.
           A rare variant of the disease may be seen in very young (neonatal) puppies is myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle).</p>
           <b style="font-size: 20px ; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" > Symptoms of Canine Parvovirus ?</b>
           <p>Symptoms often associated with CPV include lethargy, depression, and loss or lack of appetite, followed by a sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.
             If your dog is experiencing bouts of bloody diarrhea and/or vomiting, CPV is only one of several potential culprits.
             Your veterinarian can run several tests to help determine whether your dog is infected with CPV.</p>
             <b style="font-size: 20px ; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How Is Heartworm Disease Treated? </b>
             <b style="font-size: 20px ; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" >What are the treatment options for dogs with CPV?</b>
              Treatment options for dogs suffering from CPV involve supportive care and management of symptoms. 
              Treatment options will vary, depending on how sick the dog is, but certain aspects are considered vital for all patients.
               A hospital stay is often necessary so that the dog can receive intravenous fluids and nutrients to replace the vast quantities lost via vomiting and diarrhea. 
              An intravenous drip is preferred because the digestive tract of stricken dogs is usually in distress and can’t tolerate or absorb what the dog needs.
               Blood transfusions may also be helpful to boost low blood cell counts that may result from CPV infecting the bone marrow.Antibiotics may be appropriate therapy for a dog suffering from CPV,
                administered either intravenously or as injections, to help fight the infection if intestinal bacteria have entered the bloodstream.
               In addition, medications to control nausea and diarrhea are sometimes useful.
               Many dogs will respond to medical therapy if it is initiated in a timely fashion, and those dogs that recover from CPV infection retain lifelong protective immunity against the strain that infected them.</p>

      <section id="Canine Distemper">
      <center>  <b > Canine Distemper</center></b><br>
        <p>Distemper is a viral disease that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems of dogs. 
          It is spread through airborne droplets or contact with infected animals.
           Symptoms include fever, coughing, vomiting, and seizures.
           Vaccination is the best way to prevent distemper.</p>
           <h3>Symptoms of Canine Distemper </h3>
           <p> Signs and symptoms of canine distemper include:

            Fever
            Nasal discharge
            Eye discharge
            Lethargy
            Sneezing
            Coughing
            Difficulty breathing
            Vomiting
            Diarrhea
            Loss of appetite
            Thickening of nose and foot pads
            Pneumonia 
            Skin sores
            Pain
            Canine distemper may also cause brain inflammation and neurological symptoms, which is often confused with rabies. Neurological symptoms of canine distemper include:
            
            Muscle twitching
            Chewing-gum fits
            Excessive saliva
            Head tilt
            Circling
            Involuntary eye movements
            Paralysis or partial paralysis
            Seizures
            At first, you may not notice symptoms of canine distemper, and it can be mistaken for other viruses and infections.
             Your dog can get a mild or severe case and may have symptoms that only last 10 days.
             However, neurological symptoms may be delayed and show up months after infection.</p>
           <h3>How to Treat Canine Distemper</h3>
           <p> There is no cure for canine distemper.
             Veterinarians diagnose distemper through a combination of clinical signs and diagnostic tests, or through a postmortem necropsy.
             Once diagnosed, care is purely supportive. 
            Veterinarians treat the diarrhea, vomiting, and neurological symptoms, prevent dehydration, and try to prevent secondary infections.
             Most vets recommend that dogs be hospitalized and separated from other dogs to prevent the spread of infection.
             The survival rate and length of infection depend on the strain of the virus and on the strength of the dog’s immune system.
              Some cases resolve as quickly as 10 days.
             Other cases may exhibit neurological symptoms for weeks and even months afterward.</p>

      <center><b  >Kennel Cough</b></center><br>
        <p>    Kennel Cough (also known as canine infectious tracheobronchitis) is a highly contagious respiratory disease.
          Dogs commonly contract kennel cough at places where large amounts of canines congregate, such as boarding and daycare facilities, dog parks, training groups, and dog shows. 
          Dogs can spread it to one another through airborne droplets, direct contact (e.g., touching noses), or contaminated surfaces (including water/food bowls).
          It’s highly treatable in most dogs but can be more severe in puppies younger than six months of age and immunocompromised dogs.<br></p>
          <b style="font-size: 20px ; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" > Symptoms of Kennel Cough?</b>
      <p>If your dog is affected with kennel cough, you may notice one or more of the following symptoms:</p>
      <ul>
      <li> <p> a strong cough, often with a “honking” sound - this is the most obvious symptom</p></li>
      <li><p>runny nose</p></li>
      <li><p>sneezing</p></li>
      <li><p>loss of appetite</p></li>
      <li><p>low fever</P></li>
      </ul>
      <b style="font-size: 20px ; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" >    How Is Kennel Cough Treated? </b>
      <p>Typically, mild cases of kennel cough are treated with a week or two of rest, but a veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics to prevent a secondary infection and cough medication to ease the symptoms.

        “Nebulizers and vaporizers utilizing inhaled antibiotics or bronchodilators have been reported to be beneficial but are usually not prescribed,” Dr. Fitzgerald said. Speak to your veterinarian for treatment recommendations.
         Also, it’s helpful for owners to use a harness rather than a collar to walk a dog with kennel cough because irritation of the tracheal can aggravate the cough and possibly even cause damage to the trachea.
         If you have a household with multiple pets and one shows signs of a cough, chances are all dogs in the home have been exposed.

      <section id="heartworm-disease">
      <center>  <b >Heartworm Disease</b> </center><br>
        <p>   Heartworm disease in dogs is a blood-borne parasitic nematode (roundworm) known as Dirofilaria immitis transmitted by mosquitoes.
			 Upwards of 30 species of mosquitoes can act as heartworm transmitters. 
			 Mosquitoes ingest immature heartworm larvae, called microfilariae, by feeding on either an infected cat or dog.
			  The microfilariae develop further for 10 to 30 days in the mosquito's gut and then enter parts of the mosquito's mouth.
			   When an infected mosquito bites a dog, it injects larvae into the dog.
			   The larvae then mature over a period of several months, eventually ending up in the right side of the heart and the pulmonary arteries.
			    Once this occurs, they mature into adult heartworms in dogs, and can reproduce about six months from the time of invasion.
			    At approximately eight months after the invasion, heartworm in dogs begin to produce a new crop of microfilariae that will live in the dog's blood for about one month. 
				By the time this occurs, their lives are in danger even though clinical signs may not be apparent yet.
        Symptoms of Heartworm Disease ?
				<p>If your dog is affected with Heartworm Disease, you may notice one or more of the following symptoms:</p>
             <ul>
<li> <p> The most obvious clinical signs of heartworm disease are a soft</p></li>
<li><p>  dry cough  </p></li>
<li><p>shortness of breath</p></li>
<li><p>weakness</p></li>
<li><p>listlessness and loss of stamina</P></li>
<li><p>weakness</p></li>
            </ul>
            <b style="font-size: 20px ; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" > How Is Heartworm Disease Treated? </b>
<p>The first step in heartworm treatments is obtaining a diagnosis. Most veterinarians use a battery of tests to determine the presence of heartworms in dogs. The first step in diagnosis of heartworm in dogs is to perform a blood test.
A urinalysis, or the testing of a dog's urineAn antigen test determines the presence of adult female heartworms Radiographs, or X-Rays to view the size and shape of a dog's heart. This is helpful because many dogs with heartworm develop enlarged pulmonary arteries, or have obstructions in the arteries leading to the lungs
An ultrasound allows us to directly view the internal structures of the heart and surrounding vessels, in order to assess the condition and function of the heart
During initial heartworm treatments, most patients are hospitalized to receive an adulticide, which is a medication that kills adult heartworms. 
The microfilariae in the body, or baby heartworms, can be eliminated with a monthly prevention, which can be administered at home.
For more severe cases, such as dogs experiencing thromboembolic complications (in which a blood clot that has formed breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to clot another vessel), hospitalization may be necessary for a longer period of time while heartworm treatments are administered.
 In some extreme cases, a surgical procedure may be necessary to remove adult worms from the right heart and pulmonary artery by way of the jugular vein.
 This procedure is recommended if the infestation consists of a high number of adult worms.</p>
